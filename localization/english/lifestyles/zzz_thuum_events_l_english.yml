 zzz_thuum_intro.0001.desc:0 "After a long day at court, [courtier.GetFullName] approaches to have a word with me.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have heard tales of a power from the north that can rend fortresses asunder, soothe animals to quietude, and even command the skies-- all just by using your Voice!"\n\nMy interest is piqued. I start to wonder what this power might do for me should I acquire it.\n\n"If we visit the priests of Kyne in Gildergreen, you might yet learn this power yourself!""
 zzz_thuum_intro.0002.desc:0 "As we approach the Temple of Kyne, I pass underneath the blossoming boughs of the Gildergreen. There is a sense of tranquility here, despite the bustle of the market nearby. A serene wind blows through the courtyard surrounding the great tree.\n\nI enter the temple, and soon after I find [priest.GetFullName], the Priest of Kyne. I humbly ask her to tell me about the Voice, and [priest.GetSheHe] obliges.\n\n"The Storm Voice is Kyne's gift to mankind. It was her daughters who passed down the secrets of the Thu'um to the first Nords, and with it they reshaped the very land around them with mighty words of power.", [priest.GetSheHe] said.\n\n"You might be able to learn this yourself: meditate on the will of the Warrior Goddess, and she may find you worthy.""
 zzz_thuum_intro.0003.desc:0 "Weeks have passed since I started meditating. Every day, I have spent time beneath the Gildergreen with the hopes of communing to Kyne.\n\nBy the end of the first week, I had tuned out most everything else around me: the chirping of birds, the buzzing of bees, and the sounds of people in the distance.\n\nI reach the end of the month, and I meditate one last time.\n\nI hear nothing, as I had the weeks before. After hours of solitude, I open my eyes to see the sun still shining on the Gildergreen.\n\n[priest.GetFullName] approaches with a solemn expression. "Nothing, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]? Perhaps Kyne does not think this is the path for you.""
 zzz_thuum_intro.0004.desc:0 "Weeks have passed since I started meditating. Every day, I have spent time beneath the Gildergreen with the hopes of communing to Kyne.\n\nBy the end of the first week, I had tuned out most everything else around me: the chirping of birds, the buzzing of bees, and the sounds of people in the distance.\n\nI reach the end of the month, and I meditate one last time.\n\nI worry that nothing will happen, as it had the last few weeks. Then, like a gentle whisper, I hear it:\n\n"Shout...""

 zzz_thuum_clavicus.1000.desc:0 "I return from my pilgrimage, a little distraught from Kyne's seeming rejection. I talk a walk through the gardens to clear my head, when I am suddenly approached by a man and his dog.\n\n"Humble greetings, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. I am [skaafin_clavicus.GetFullName], and I believe I might be able to help you. See, a little bird told me that you prayed to Kyne for the power of the Storm Voice, and I also heard that it might not have been as successful as you would have liked."\n\nHe then bows, a smug smile on his face.\n\n"If you still wish for such power, then I can beseech the great Clavicus Vile to intercede on your behalf. You need only tell me what kind of Voice it is you wish for.""
 zzz_thuum_siege_events.1000.desc:0 "The air grows heavy as you step before the enemy stronghold, your lungs filling with the breath of the Dovah.\n\nWith a thunderous cry, your Thu'um erupts from deep within you — a force not of this world.\n\nStone cracks, towers groan, and before the stunned eyes of your foes, the walls of their proud holding collapse like brittle parchment."
 zzz_thuum_siege_events.1000.a:0 "With a breath of fury! Fus!"
 zzz_thuum_siege_events.1000.b:0 "Tear a hole in their walls! Fus Ro!"
 zzz_thuum_siege_events.1000.c:0 "Unleash the unrelenting force! Fus Ro Dah!"

 zzz_thuum_kyne_peace.1000.desc:0 "From the quiet edges of the wild, several shapes begin to emerge, drawn by the calm that flows from your voice.\n\nThey approach without fear, meeting you with silent understanding. One of them will walk beside you — the choice is now yours to make.\n\nI should..."

 zzz_thuum_clavicus.1001.desc:0 "The council had gathered to settle festering disputes, but old grudges flared into chaos. As the shouting escalated, you rose to command order — yet the Thu’um slipped free, raw and uncontrolled.\n\nThe chamber buckled under the force of your Voice, stone cracked, and fire was blown out in a gust of ancient power.\n\nWhen the dust cleared, few lay dead... and blood ran from your nose as darkness edged your vision."
 zzz_thuum_clavicus.1002.desc:0 "The council had gathered to settle festering disputes, but old grudges flared into chaos. As the shouting escalated, you rose to command order — yet the Thu’um slipped free, raw and uncontrolled.\n\nThe Thu’um erupted without restraint, shaking the walls, splintering the table, and sending every soul in the room staggering back in terror.\n\nNo one was harmed… but all who stood in that chamber now look upon you with reverence, dread, and a quiet understanding: you are not merely a ruler — you are a force of nature."
 zzz_thuum_clavicus.1003.desc:0 "The council had gathered to settle festering disputes, but old grudges flared into chaos. As the shouting escalated, you rose to command order — yet the Thu’um slipped free, raw and uncontrolled.\n\nThe Thu’um erupted without restraint, shaking the walls, splintering the table, and sending every soul in the room staggering back in terror.\n\nNo one died… but a few were wounded, and none present will ever forget the raw, untamed might you revealed. You are no longer just a ruler in their eyes — but something more dangerous."

 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0001.desc:0 "I have spent enough time over tomes of tales and history that I believe I know the location of another Word Wall. If my research is correct, then I may yet discover a new Word of Power that I can learn.\n\nThere's only one way to know for sure. I should fund an expedition that will seek out the Word Wall in question.\n\nI immediately put out a bounty, and in short order, three candidates stepped forward to answer the call."
 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0002.desc:0 ""The ruin is cleared, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] — the dangers were many, but your wisdom led us true," says [chosen_exped.GetFullName] as they step through the doors. At last, the expedition has returned.\n\n"The Word Wall stands untouched in the depths… waiting for you", [chosen_exped.GetSheHe] added.\n\nAs though it were meant to be, my research was validated. After months of waiting, I'm itching to visit the Word Wall.\n\nNow that I know that the Word Wall exists at [location.GetName], I can take the time to meditate on its Word of Power and make it mine."
 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0003.desc:0 "Months have passed since the expedition departed. They have sent word to inform me that they cleared the last part of the ruin and found no Word Wall, only angry draugr that had to be dealt with.\n\nI must've been mistaken. Perhaps further research will be needed to find the location of a Word Wall..."
 #zzz_thuum_learn_word.0010.desc:0 "I have scoured every tome, every fragment of lore, yet nothing points clearly to a new Word Wall — only scattered hints and uncertain echoes. Still, something stirs in my mind, a pattern just out of reach.\n\nIf I can piece together the truth from these fragments, I may yet uncover the location of a Word of Power lost to time."

 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0001.a:0 "[option_one.GetFullName] seems able-bodied."
 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0001.b:0 "I think [option_two.GetFullName] would do great."
 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0001.c:0 "Is [option_three.GetFullName] the best canditate?"

 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0010.desc:0 "My recent efforts in study have yielded little — no new leads, no signs, no whispers of hidden Word Walls.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies not in old texts, but within myself. I am still just a [GetTrait('thuum_trait_track').GetName(ROOT.Char)], after all.\n\nPerhaps I need to improve my mastery trait to awaken deeper insight for more Word Wall locations."
 zzz_thuum_learn_word.0010.a.desc:0 "I have scoured every tome, every fragment of lore, yet nothing points clearly to a new Word Wall — only scattered hints and uncertain echoes.\n\nAs a [GetTrait('thuum_trait_track').GetName(ROOT.Char)], my guts tell me that I may have discovered all the locations of Words of Power."

 zzz_thuum_intro.2200.desc:0 "I consult the maps that my expedition provided for the location of the Word Wall at the barrows in [location.GetName], thinking over the logistics it would take to safely see me to it.\n\nOnce I am there, all that is left is for me to ruminate on the word's meaning.\n\nIt might be time for me to set off on my journey."

 zzz_thuum_intro.2500.desc:0 "I consult the maps that my expedition provided for the location of the Word Wall at the Northwind Summit near [location.GetName], thinking over the logistics it would take to safely see me to it.\n\nOnce I am there, all that is left is for me to ruminate on the word's meaning.\n\nIt might be time for me to set off on my journey."

 zzz_thuum_intro.2201.desc:0 "I climb the last set of steps and was greeted by a stunning sight: Bleak Falls Barrow. Sturdy arches yet stood, framing the front of the ancient temple.\n\nGolden Claw in hand, I followed the notes of my expedition which lead me to the inner sanctum. There I found the Word Wall, illuminated by sunlight streaming through a hole in the cavern ceiling.\n\nThough I cannot read the words carved on the wall, I can feel one of them calling to me."

 zzz_thuum_intro.2203.desc:0 "Several weeks have passed by and still I am no closer to understanding the Word of Power.\n\nI know it is here. I can feel it. But no matter how hard I have tried, I cannot figure out which word it is.\n\nA soldier from my retinue informs me that our rations have dwindled. I can return and try again in due time, but for now we should return home."
